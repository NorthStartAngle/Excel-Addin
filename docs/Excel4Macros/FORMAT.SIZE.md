FORMAT.SIZE
===========

Equivalent to sizing an object with the mouse. Sizes the selected object
and returns TRUE. If the selected chart object cannot be sized,
FORMAT.SIZE returns FALSE. There are two syntax forms of this function.
Use syntax 1 to size worksheet objects and chart items absolutely. Use
syntax 2 relative to a cell or range of cells to size only worksheet
objects. It is generally easier to use the macro recorder to enter this
function on your macro sheet.

Syntax 1   Sizes worksheet objects and chart items

Syntax 2   Sizes worksheet objects relative to a cell or range
